0x16. C - SIMPLE SHELL

This is a TEAM Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. The objective of this project is to understand the concept about building shell from scratch in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Team Members: Lawrence Maduabuchi & Abdullahi Ngui
* Date: May 10th 2023




## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ` 0. Betty would be proud`| Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.|
| ` 1. Simple shell 0.1` | Write a UNIX command line interpreter.|
| ` 2. Simple shell 0.2` | Simple shell 0.1 +.|
| `3. Simple shell 0.3` | Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.|
| ` 4. Simple shell 0.4` | Simple shell 0.3 +|
| ` 5. Simple shell 1.0` | Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.|
| ` 6. Simple shell 0.1.1` | Write your own getline function, use a buffer to read many chars at once call the least possible the read system call. |
| ` 7. Simple shell 0.2.1` | Simple shell 0.2 +.|
| ` 8. Simple shell 0.4.1` | Simple shell 0.4 +; handle arguments for the built-in exit; Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell. |
| ` 9. Setenv, unsetenv` | Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands.|
| ` 10. cd` | Implement the builtin command cd:|
| ` 11. ;` | Simple shell 1.0 +. Handle the command seperator|
| ` 12. && and ||` | Handle the && and || shell logical operators.|
| ' 13. alias - Simple shell 1.0+ | Implement the alias builtin command; Usage: alias [name[='value']...].|
| ' 14. Variables - Handles variable replacement, Handle the $? variable, Handle the $$ variable|
| ' 15. Comments - A program that handles comments (#) using simple shell 1.0+ Git repository: simple shell. |
| ' 16. File as Input - Usage: simple_shell [filename]; Your shell can take a file as command line argument. The file contains all commands line arguement; The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting; The file should contain one commanf line; in this mode, the shell should not print a promptand should not read from stdin |
